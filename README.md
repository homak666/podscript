# podscript
A Python script to download podcast from a database and make a transcript of it.

Path to Transcript folder and database needs to be changed before using the script.
Scipt utilises Whisper by OpenAI to make transcripts.

I am only learning and this script was done with some help from GPT3.5 and 4, so if you do a pull request - explain it well.
